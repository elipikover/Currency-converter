# Currency-converter
**Currency convertor project**


This is a currency-converter project done for the purpose of learning basic coding in Java using OOP principles.

Flow:

The program asks the user what currency to convert to or from via numeric choice menu
1. USD->NIS
2. NIS->USD

Thne asks the user for amount to convert in double, shows the result to user and asks if he/she would like to do another conversion

in each stage if user enters wrong input the he can retry

If the user choose not to do another conversion the program prints all previous results
writes all results to results.txt (file), and quits.
